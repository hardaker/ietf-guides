<p>The IETF Guides Program matches experienced IETF participants with newcomers in order to aid their integration into the IETF community through advice, help, and collected wisdom.
    The guidance provided should speed up the time it takes for newcomers to become active, contributing members of the IETF.</p>
<p>Please note that this is separate from the <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/leadership/fellowship-to-ietf/">Internet Society Fellowship to the IETF</a> program.</p>
